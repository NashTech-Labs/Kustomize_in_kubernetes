# Kustomize_in_kubernetes
Kustomize is an open-source configuration management tool. It is used to kustomize or change the configuration of manifests (Deployments) without even touching the actual manifest in the production. Kustomize can handle multiple manifests at one time. 
## Kustomize apply
1. kubectl apply -f kustomization.yaml
2. This way we can deploy multiple manifests with one command.
